# Lessons Learned

Postcss and Tailwind

- postcss doesn't not support ESM, .ts, or any other modern tailwind config file
- postcss requires a import of globalStyles for each app which is a pain. Inline injected css might be better.

Module Federation

- module-federation/next-js 7.0.8 [doesn't support app router]("https://github.com/module-federation/universe/issues/1183")

NextJs 13

App router

- nextjs 13 introduced the new app router and claims it's stable but the react ecosystem is not
  caught up. Many packages and features aren't capatible with app router.
